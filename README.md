# HangmanV1
A simple hangman game done in Python over Google Colab
Part of a Data Science bootcamp I am enrolled in with WBS Coding School
Built and ran in Google Collab
One part of the code; for clearing the console window after a turn; needs to be altered if running locally or elsewhere other than Google Collab. These changes have been market with comments and appropriate commands for Win/Mac.
